      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>Between 1 and 4 weeks, the generally accepted calculation is that a baby needs approximately 2.5oz of breastmilk per pound of weight. Before 1 week, you really should talk to an expert.</p>
      <p>After 4 weeks of age, most sources say a baby will eat 24-30 ounces a day. We assume that once a baby is older than 4 weeks and heavier than 12 pounds, they will eat a maximum of 30oz. and calculate accordingly.</p>
      <p>After 6 months of age, most children begin eating solids, which reduces their need for breastmilk. Please talk to an expert about what your baby needs.</p>
      <p>All calculations assume the baby being fed was born at term. Premature babies may have vastly different needs (or the calculations may only apply to adjusted age, not actual age).</p>
