# Milk Monster

An amount-per-feed calculator for expressed breast milk.

## Technical README

Is react overkill for this? Detrimental from a perf standpoint? Yes. Am I just trying to keep my fingers in the pie while on maternity leave? Also yes.

App spun up with create-react-app and hacked together.

I'm a terrible developer who hasn't written any unit tests for the actual logic-heavy portion of this app.
